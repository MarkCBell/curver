Curver is a program for performing calculations in the curve complex.
It implements the Bell--Webb algorithm to determine the Nielsen--Thurston type of a mapping class.
This algorithm runs in polynomial time but the constants involved currently make this implementation impractical.

Curver officially supports Python 3.8 -- 3.12.
Unoffically, it also runs on `PyPy`_ and `Sage`_ with some care.

Quickstart
----------

Curver is available on `PyPI`_, so it can be installed via::

    $ pip install curver --user --upgrade

Once installed, try it inside of Python::

    >>> import curver
    >>> S = curver.load(0, 5)
    >>> S('s_0.s_1.s_0') == S('s_1.s_0.s_1')
    True
    >>> f = S('s_0.s_1.s_2.s_3')
    >>> g = S('s_0.s_1.s_3.s_2')
    >>> h = S('s_0.s_1.S_2.S_3')
    >>> f.order(), g.order(), h.order()
    (5, 5, 5)
    >>> f.is_conjugate_to(g)
    True
    >>> f.is_conjugate_to(g)
    False
